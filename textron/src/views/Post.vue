                                    CARTERSVILLE, GA – Textron Ground Support Equipment Inc., a Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) company and a leading supplier of ground 
                                    support equipment for the global aviation industry, is proud to announce that it will collaborate with General Motors (GM) and 
                                    Powertrain Control Solutions (PCS) to electrify its diverse product line.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Together, GM and PCS have developed an integrated driveline, specifically designed for Textron GSE products, that utilizes GM’s 
                                    lithium-ion battery systems. The driveline will allow Textron GSE to leverage GM’s experience in electric propulsion solutions, 
                                    honed over more than 25 years of developing a variety of electric vehicle systems and other zero-emissions innovations. The 
                                    program also continues a long-standing relationship between GM and PCS, which have worked together since 2013 to integrate GM 
                                    technologies into products that meet the unique and rigorous requirements of the GSE industry.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “This technology, designed especially for ground support operations, will enable Textron GSE to broaden its electric product 
                                    offerings across our TUG®, Premier™, Douglas and Safeaero™ brands, and elevate electrification across our entire industry,” 
                                    said Matt Chaffin, vice president and general manager, GSE for Textron Specialized Vehicles Inc. “We are committed to advancing 
                                    the GSE industry by developing sustainable technologies and leveraging leading technology to electrify the next generation of 
                                    ground support equipment.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The high-voltage lithium-ion battery systems to be used in Textron GSE products offer numerous advantages compared to low-voltage 
                                    systems, including faster charging, longer range between charges, higher operating efficiency and improvements to electronic 
                                    features like HVAC and advanced driver-assistance systems.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The systems benefit from stringent automotive testing and safety standards and include multiple tiers of safeguards to enhance 
                                    on-ramp safety. The systems constantly monitor for ground faults, disconnected connectors, or other potential hazards, and include 
                                    a manual safety disconnect for lock-out/tag-out procedures.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition, the systems will incorporate innovative safety features introduced by PCS into the GSE industry, such as electronic 
                                    transmission controls and an electric parking brake, each of which can communicate with the vehicle’s electric drivetrain and other 
                                    onboard systems to enhance safety.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “We are excited to integrate GM’s proven electrification product with Textron GSE’s world-class ground support offerings,” said 
                                    Dan Boucher, president of PCS. “Our focus is to build upon GM’s systematic approach toward safety and efficiency without 
                                    compromising the performance and reliability that is critical in ground support equipment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “We look forward to bringing the technology that is revolutionizing the on-highway vehicle market into GSE. This solution leverages 
                                    safety features, mass production scale, and versatile charging strategies to make electrification a seamless possibility for all 
                                    airports globally.”
